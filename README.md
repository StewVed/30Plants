Inspiration for this project came from:
Just One Thing - with Michael Mosley: Food Special with Tim Spector (https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p09by3yy)

The tips in the episode were:

1st tip:
Reduce or avoid Ultra Pocessed Foods.
We in the UK have the highest consumption of UPFs in Europe, and also have the highest rates of child and adult obesity.


2nd tip:
Experiment with your foods - start by changing breakfast
Record your mood and hunger levels two to three hours after eating breakfast


3rd tip:
Fermented foods
Yoghurt, Kefir, Kimchee


4th tip:
Time restricted eating/intermittent fasting


5th and final "Just one thing" tip
Eat 30 different plants a week
fruit, vegatable, seed, nut, herb, spice.
coffee is a fermented bean for example.
potato chips, rice, and pasta don't really count.


Dr Mosley's "Just one thing" is medeteranian diet.

Also, tastes can change over time - try different stuff every so often.
